SAY;DNA Profiling is a modern procedure in forensic investigation, that can identify individuals based off of their genetics.
SAY;This is possible because even though people may share certain visible properties, like hair or eye color, their DNA will be different.

SAY;DNA is extracted from items a suspect may have come in contact with at a crime scene like clothing or tools.

SAY;These objects may contain some biological material like blood, saliva, hair, and other substances or tissue.
SAY;Technological advancements have allowed very small samples such as skin cells to be analyzed, which may be left behind by simply touching an object.

SAY;Reference DNA samples must be collected from suspects to be compared to DNA evidence at a crime scene, which is usually done by swabbing the mouth.
IMAGE;slide4-1.png
SAY;Both samples are analyzed by finding regions in which there are many repeated strings of DNA, called short tandem repeats (STRs).

SAY;This data is stored and displayed in an electropherogram chart, which plots the regions data by the number of repeats.

SAY;It's then compared to the reference DNA to see if it matches up.

SAY;Now a simple simulation of these DNA samples will be ran, and it's your job to compare them!
SAY;The DNA from the crime scene and the DNA of a few related individuals will be displayed.
SAY;If you choose the one that closest matches the crime scene, you gain points.
SAY;The difficulty will increase the more correct guesses you make, try to get the highest score you can in the allowed amount of time.
SAY;Good luck!
